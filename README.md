Barnsley Fern
=============
This is an implementation of the Barnsley Fern in Swift using Core Graphics. The two main components are **FernController** and **FernView**. Although this code is technically valid Swift 1.2, it was developed in Xcode 7 beta, so it may require some work to run it in earlier versions of Xcode. The image is currently generated from 1 million points, but you can change this number in **ViewController**
